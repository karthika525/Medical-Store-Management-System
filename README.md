# 💊 Medical Store Management System

A full-stack **Express + MongoDB** web application that allows store managers to manage medicines, track stock, and maintain records securely with authentication and session management.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system helps a **medical store manager** efficiently handle medicine inventory with features like login authentication, CRUD operations, search, pagination, and stock tracking.

Each user manages **their own medicines**, and all records are stored securely in MongoDB.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 User Authentication

* User Signup with validation
* Secure Login using **bcrypt password hashing**
* Session-based authentication
* Logout functionality

---

### 💊 Medicine Management

* Add new medicines with stock quantity
* Each medicine stores:

  * Name
  * Stock
  * Added date & time
* Edit medicine details
* Delete medicines

---

### ⚠️ Business Rule

* A logged-in user can add **maximum 10 medicines**
* After reaching the limit, an error message is shown

---

### 🔎 Search & Pagination

* Search medicines by name
* Pagination for medicine listing
* Displays newest medicines first

---

### 👤 User-Specific Data

* Each user can only:

  * View their own medicines
  * Manage their own records

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers → stored in MongoDB
2. Password is hashed using bcrypt
3. Login creates a session
4. Protected routes require login

---

### Medicine Flow

1. User adds medicine → saved with user ID
2. Data is displayed in list page
3. Supports edit, delete, search & pagination
